# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
In machine learning, Na√Øve Bayes classification is a straightforward and powerful algorithm for the classification task.In this notebook, I have implemented Naive Bayes Classification algorithm with Python and Scikit-Learn. I have built a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year.
